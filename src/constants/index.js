      "This project highlights UI/UX design, leveraging the psychological principle that eye direction in images can subtly influence where users focus their attention. Scientific studies show that when a person in an image looks in a certain direction, viewers are subconsciously guided to follow that gaze. This concept is often used in marketing to direct attention to products or key information. Inspired by this, the website design incorporates visual elements that guide users naturally. The focus is on optimizing user interaction, alongside performance enhancements such as route lazy loading, caching with keep-alive, and image lazy loading, creating a seamless browsing experience.",
